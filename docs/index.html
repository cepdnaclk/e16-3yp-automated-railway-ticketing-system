                    <p class="lead">In srilanka people waste there valuable time by spending in long queues in railway stations. Eventhough people donot get better experiance when travelling. This problem effects badly on every aspects in day to day life of passengers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">And another thing is using cardboard tickets for entrances increases environmental pollusions and keeping several officers for ticket issueing increase the government expenses.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6 text-center">
                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Introducing fully automated system which consisted of automatic gates and realtime web services.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">This reduces the time wastage as passengers have several entrances and no unefficient human involvements for ticketing. No environmental pollusion any more as no tickets in the system. This will make the life easier.

                        Every passenger should enroll to the department and when he/she enroll will get a plastic card which has a key to his/her account. Passenger can recharge their account at the cashier. When he/she enters to the platform he/she only
                        have to swipe the card and the starting point will be added to the database.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Then they can seated anywhere he/she like Ticket checker will swipe their card again and class(1,2,3) will be added to the database. Finally passenger should swipe their card at the destination station. Then the cost will be deducted from their account.
                        The gate at the destination will be closed until this procedure for each passenger.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">All money transactions and travelling history can be tracked and a database can be managed. All of the details related to passengers account can be managed by using app or website.

                        Initially passenger have to register in our system and then he/she will be given a passenger card and then he/she can swipe the card and enter the station.
                        At the entrance our system will verify the passenger account, check that there is sufficient money in the passsenger account(the minimum balance should be 500.00 RS) or any other system error 
                        like account freezing.Account freezing will happen when the passenger leave destination station without paying the travel cost.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        If there is no such error and if there is no any illegal activity at his entrance, then he can enter to the train.When entering to the train his/her account will be holded
                        until he/she leaves destination after swiping.In the train ticket checker checks 
                        about the passenger class.Then at the exit, passenger has to swipe the card and system releases the holded accuont and if the passenger don't swipe 
                        the card then account will be freezed. In the freeze state what happens is, he can't enter from an entrance gate without paying our fine.

                        several main functionalities of the web application was tested.
                        For the testing purpose we used unit testing on the middlewares and some integration testings.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Testing gives the clear overview of outcomes of the functionalities.It is very helpful in debugging and diagnosing.
                        so these are helpful to enhance the code. Doing these test with  development saves the cost and enhance the security aspects.
                        It automatically uplift the product quality and ensure the customer satisfaction.

                        For testing the backend(Nodejs) of our server, we used Mocha, Jest and chai.They give the clear understanding about the details about 
                        the end points in out api. The main usage was using unit testing we were able to find the bugs in the authentication purpose of the admin and users.
                        The full details about our testing results were given on the github repo of out project.
